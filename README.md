**CopyKerningTo-Glyphs** – This script helps you copy exception kerning or single kernings from one glyph to another.
 

##  How it works
<img width="401" height="229" alt="ViewWindowGlyph" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4854789-a331-4f5d-8033-0019672699c6" />

The script opens a window. Then you type in lines like this:

baseglyph = targetglyph

Ex. : n = ñ



When you click Copy, the script looks through all kerning pairs in all masters and duplicates any kerning attached to the baseglyph onto the targetglyph. Works for both left and right kerning.
